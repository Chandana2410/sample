        <p class="design-para1">
            A true and gunuine friendship like ours is so strong, meaningful, and long lasting.
        Words are not enough to describe our friendship.
        When no one understand me, U did and supported me a lot in every situation.
        Our bond is so strong that, it can't break by anyone, we fighted a lot but instead of seperating, we became too close more than before.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes if i get anger that doesn't mean i'm ignoring you or will leave, my anger is nothing infront of our friendship.
        It would be shame to me if I can't realize how lucky I am to have you in my life.
        Today isn't just special day, it's a day where unique person with a fabulous personality was born.
        You are the only one where I can be real me.
       <br>
       <br>
        To me you are really a gem.
        You have been with me in my bad days and obviously in good days too.
        You had listened all my nonsense talks neither stopped me nor bored of those talks, instead you said me to continue. Every girl needs a male bestie like you. our bond will never break because love would get boring one day friendship won't.
        I will cherish our frienship forever in life.
